The sky above is heavy with dark clouds, and the wind howls through the branches of the gnarled trees that surround the sprawling estate. The Manor itself looms before you, a foreboding presence that seems to crouch on the edge of the world, waiting to pull you into its shadows. Despite the overgrown garden and the sense of abandonment, the house still exudes a strange magnetism that draws you closer. You can't help but wonder what secrets and horrors lie within its walls. As you step through the creaking gate, you realize that the only way to satisfy your curiosity is to venture inside and face whatever darkness awaits you.");

You find yourself standing in a dimly lit corridor, shrouded in shadow and dust. The walls are adorned with ancient tapestries that hang limply, the threadbare fabric revealing only faint traces of what were once grand designs. The air is thick with the musty scent of age, and every step you take sends plumes of dust dancing into the air.");

But as you strain to hear more, the whispers fade away, leaving you with an uneasy feeling. You realize that you must choose which door to open, and with a deep breath, you take a step forward, steeling yourself for whatever lies ahead.");
