package OOP.ec22532.MP;/* This is a magical house where each door is a portal that connects to a 'room' in random locations. There are 3 floors.
   Each floor has one room apart from the to floor which had two. Leading to these rooms are hallways and staricases that the
   visitor has the option of searching (to find some gold). 

   The staricase leading the the top floow requires an item obtained in one of the rooms to be able to unlock a cabinet to 
   obtain the gold. Another staircase has decorations hinting at what an answer is in the quiz taken in Room_e221156 (the 
   quiz can only be taken on the second (or more) visit).

   Each staricase/hallway has a different number of gold to be found. Each staricase/hallway has one search location that 
   contains gold coins. Due to the "We don't have much time" story element, the visitor can only search one place each time 
   they are in a staircase/hallway.

   Once the visitor is deposited back at the main enterance, they have the option of continuing to explore the house if 
   they wish to, allowing them to enter different rooms or the same room however many times they want.
