explanation of the room:
the room will give the user 5 gold a vintage watch (if the user doe not have a "watch" item with them)
and it return's the user to the opposite end from whichever direction they came from.
To get the item, you need to keep sitting on the chair five times, at that point a figure will appear and give you the gold and item
