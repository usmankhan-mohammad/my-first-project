mini project
//majority of mini project code is done in GUIVisitor.java
//program may bug if you click yes or no too fast
//could not implement a scrollbar in time, if the console is too full, it is editable, you can remove some text to make room
//had to slightly change visitor, the rooms and the houses to accomodate for certain changes
